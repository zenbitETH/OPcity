## OPstack Test Deployments
This section presents the results of three test deployments conducted in December 2023 and two in June 2024. Our findings highlight a significant reduction in batcher and proposer operation costs when using the OP Stack V4.0.0 Canyon in December, compared to the dual deployment conducted in June 2024 with OP Stack V7.0.0. The June benchmarks compared the usage of call data methods versus data blobs for registering data in Layer 1, revealing that call data consumes approximately 60% more resources than data blobs, making the latest a more viable solution for networks with high usage volumes, while call data fits for experimental or moderate network usage volume.
