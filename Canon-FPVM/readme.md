## 1. Fault Proofs Theoretical Framework

### Ethereum Scalability 

Ethereum has emerged as one of the most important blockchain platforms, providing a decentralized network that has transformed how applications are developed and operated. Unlike traditional systems, Ethereum is an open-source, decentralized computing network that allows developers to create and run smart contracts, supporting a wide range of decentralized applications (dApps). 

Ethereum operates as a state transition system, where transactions modify the global state of accounts and balances, powered by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), a versatile programming environment for executing complex smart contracts and dApps[[1]](https://www.notion.so/OP-city-stack-report-fff3905fdc3a800b8b07e6a55b59d456?pvs=21). Smart contracts are Ethereum's standout feature. These self-executing agreements, encoded on the blockchain, enable automated and trustless interactions. They are widely used for custom tokens, financial products, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), file storage solutions, and more, with the blockchain's immutability and irreversibility ensuring these contracts operate with high integrity, resiliency, and transparency[[2]](https://www.notion.so/OP-city-stack-report-fff3905fdc3a800b8b07e6a55b59d456?pvs=21). However, Ethereum faces the “blockchain trilemma”. This challenge involves simultaneously achieving scalability, decentralization, and security, but enhancing one aspect often compromises the others. Transactions per second (TPS) measure scalability, decentralization distributes control across the network, preventing censorship and manipulation, and security focuses on attack resistance[[3]](https://www.notion.so/OP-city-stack-report-fff3905fdc3a800b8b07e6a55b59d456?pvs=21). 

### Rollups as Layer 2 solution
Traditional chains like Bitcoin or Ethereum are secure and decentralized but with limited scalability. To tackle the scalability challenges, Ethereum has explored "simple techniques" as Layer 2 solutions that scale up by having different applications live on multiple chains with a crosschain communication protocol for interoperability. This approach is decentralized and scalable but not secure since an attacker only needs a consensus node majority to break the main chain and cause collateral effects to other chains[[4]](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2021/04/07/sharding.html). Most of this security weakness occurs because the blocks generated by these technologies are not fully verified, as is the case with Layer 1. Instead, they only contain the parts of the state required to process the block, plus some hashes to prove that the parts of the state provided represent the claimed state in the block. This solution involves computation and data availability verification to check that the system did the computation correctly, assuming that block validators have all the inputs required and that the inputs to the computation themselves are stored somewhere so that anyone can download them if they are needed[[5]](https://github.com/ethereum/research/wiki/A-note-on-data-availability-and-erasure-coding).

In the context of rollups, there are two technologies capable to process both verifications with a proof mechanism as security safeguard:
1. Optimistic Rollups, which assume all transactions are valid and uses fraud proofs to prove false transactions within 7 days. 
2. Zero Knowledge (ZK) Rollups, that instantly prove if transactions are valid or not using validity proofs.

### Fault Proofs
In optimistic rollups, fraud/fault proofs come into play if a dispute arises to detect and prove that a particular block or transaction is invalid through merkalized data, allowing nodes in the network to receive and verify block states without downloading the entire blockchain, assuming that there is at least one honest node willing to generate them[[6]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.09044). This mechanism is also known as interactive game [[7]](https://specs.optimism.io/fault-proof/index.html) where, any participant optimistacally assume that every proposed result is valid by default[[8]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17555).
